## About myself:

I have been dreaming about working in IT since high school. So, after graduation I entered *the faculty of programming in computer systems* and a year after getting a diploma took courses *Junior Front-end Developer*. However, I didn't find a job in IT in my town and began to work in another field.

After a few years and moving to Moscow i decided to resume studying. I want to continue developing in this field because it still interests me a lot.
