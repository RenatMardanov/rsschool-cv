## About myself:

I have been dreaming about working in IT since high school. So, after graduation I entered *the faculty of programming in computer systems* and a year after getting a diploma took courses *Junior Front-end Developer*. However, I didn't find a job in IT in my town and began to work in another field.

After a few years and moving to Moscow i decided to resume studying. I want to continue developing in this field because it still interests me a lot.

## Skills

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JS Basic
* GIT

## Code example

```
const filterString = (string, symbol) => {
let i = 0;
let result = '';
while (i < string.length) {
  if (string[i] !== symbol) {
    result = `${result}${string[i]}`;
      } else {
    result = `${result}`;
  }
  i = i + 1;
}
return result;
}
```
